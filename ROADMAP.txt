v0.1 (delivered)
	. First implementation of PictStock, which was not very customizable (folder structure 
	of photo directory was for instance immutable)
	
v0.2 (delivered)
	. Folder structure and photos names are now fully customizable
	. Refactoring to ease tremendously maintenance
	
v0.3 (delivered)
	. PictFrame: a new program to choose randomly photos to display on a digital frame
	. Improve the Date class to speed up all related operations (underlying C struct tm
	instead of cumbersome string comparisons)
	
v0.4
	. Introduce a sqlite database to handle photographers & cameras data (currently hardcoded 
	with my own data, which makes the photographer feature entirely unusable for someone
	else than myself...)
	
v0.5
	. General clean-up: uniformize (and maybe use sqlite as well) parameters input files,
	and better error handling (some functions or methods call directly exit(), which is not
	clean even if those are the ones assumed to be called at the very beginning of the program)
	
v0.6
	. Clean exiv2 library: 
		- Currently the evix2 library is a copy done at a moment that has been
		tweaked a bit for my need (only compilation-related). 
		- The Windows compilation peculiarly is a scary process that need some work
		- Many warnings in compilation that are bothersome when compiling PictStock;
		maybe work a bit on them and propose a path to exiv2 guys if not solved 
		(I posted a ticket on their forum but exiv2 seems in development hell...)
	
Future
	. IHM (wxWidget? something else?)	
	. Some modifications when all compilers I use (g++, clang, MSVC) implement all the
	C++11 features I want to use
	. Redmine (GitHub project manager is too scarce and cumbersome to use; I gave up)
