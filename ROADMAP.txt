v0.1 (delivered)
	. First implementation of PictStock, which was not very customizable (folder structure 
	of photo directory was for instance immutable)
	
v0.2 (delivered)
	. Folder structure and photos names are now fully customizable
	. Refactoring to ease tremendously maintenance
	
v0.3 
	. PictFrame: a new program to choose randomly photos to display on a digital frame
	. Improve the Date class to speed up all related operations (underlying C struct tm
	instead of cumbersome string comparisons)
	
v0.4
	. Introduce sqlite to handle photographers (and remove dreadful hardcoded data)
	. Use also sqlite to manage configuration (instead of current input parameters file)
	
v0.5
	. Implement a QT interface for PictStock and PictFrame
	
v0.6
	. Add in the QT interface utilities to modify exif (peculiarly the date). Date should
	be modifiable by photo but also for an entire directory (this should replace the 
	cumbersome way to do so given to PictStock, which is quite tedious to use because it asks
	for each folder what to do)
	. Add language support (using QT facilities for that)
	
v0.7
	. Clean exiv2 library: 
		- Currently the evix2 library is a copy done at a moment that has been
		tweaked a bit for my need (only compilation-related). 
		- The Windows compilation peculiarly is a scary process that need some work
		- Many warnings in compilation that are bothersome when compiling PictStock;
		maybe work a bit on them and propose a path to exiv2 guys if not solved 
		(I posted a ticket on their forum but exiv2 seems in development hell...)
	
Future
	. Some modifications when all compilers I use (g++, clang, MSVC) implement all the
	C++11 features I want to use
	. Redmine (GitHub project manager is too scarce and cumbersome to use; I gave up)
