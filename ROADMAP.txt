v0.1 (delivered)
	. First implementation of PictStock, which was not very customizable (folder structure 
	of photo directory was for instance immutable)
	
v0.2 (delivered)
	. Folder structure and photos names are now fully customizable
	. Refactoring to ease tremendously maintenance
	
v0.3 (cancelled)
	Was not properly delivered due to lack of testing; all foreseen content has therefore
	been delivered in v0.4 (couldn't rename it as branches were already labelled v0.4)
	
v0.4 (delivered)
	. PictFrame: a new program to choose randomly photos to display on a digital frame
	. Improve the Date class to speed up all related operations (underlying C struct tm
	instead of cumbersome string comparisons)
	. Introduce sqlite to handle photographers (and remove dreadful hardcoded data)
	. Use also sqlite to manage configuration (instead of current input parameters file)
	
v0.5
	. Implement a QT interface for PictStock and PictFrame
	. Add in the QT interface utility to modify exif (peculiarly the date). Date should
	be modifiable by photo but also for an entire directory (this should replace the 
	cumbersome way to do so given to PictStock, which is quite tedious to use because it asks
	for each folder what to do)
	. Handle parameters through QT and database (instead of parameter file)
	. Add also another utility to handle photographers and camera (to be able to
	introduce or remove cameras and photographers)
	. Add language support (using QT facilities for that)
