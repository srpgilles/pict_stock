About the Yuni project
======================

Yuni is a cross-platform C++ framework for developing high-level, complex and
fast applications. This framework intends to provide the most complete set of
coherent API as possible related to 3D programming, especially 3D simulation
and game programming. It intends to be a reliable and simple bridge between
different worlds, allowing to write all sorts of applications, while letting
the developer focus on her real work.

The Yuni project is connected to all these domains :
 - 3D graphics
 - Physics
 - 2D/3D User Interface in 3D context
 - 2D/3D Input devices
 - Sound, playback of 2D/3D sounds
 - Scripting languages
 - Artificial Intelligence, mainly on 3D objects
 - Threading / Parallel computing
 - Networking
 - Real-time multi-user Collaboration
 - And any other domain related to multimedia or user interaction.


Target audience
---------------

The Yuni library and tools are meant to be used by developers who
already know C++, like it and want to use it for writing any kind of
application without worrying about the low-level aspects of the
language and the trouble of mixing many kinds of libraries to do all
the usual things any application requires.

Big applications always end up requiring performance at some point,
multi-threading at some other, graphics, sound, input, command line
parsing, ... Yuni will provide all this in a portable way with a
single, easy-to-use, object-oriented API.
