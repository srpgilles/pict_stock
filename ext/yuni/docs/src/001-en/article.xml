<h2>What is Yuni ?</h2>
<p>
Yuni is a cross-platform C++ framework for developing high-level, complex and
fast applications. Yuni can be useful in all kinds of applications, from simple
100-line programs to full-blown 3D applications. It intends to provide a complete
set of coherent API and to be a reliable and simple bridge between different
worlds, allowing to write all sorts of applications while letting the developer
focus on her real work.
