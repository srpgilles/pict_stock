	** The point is to make sure no photo is lost and that a same photo can't be duplicated

	** The names of the pictures must be relevant: if there is 2 photos in the same minute they should
	** be indexed "1" and "2", not the first without index and the second with "1" or "2"
	**
	** For instance:
	**  [good]
	**  	Photo_1313_CSG_1.jpg
	**  	Photo_1313_CSG_2.jpg
	**  [bad]
	**  	Photo_1313_CSG.jpg
	**  	Photo_1313_CSG_2.jpg
	**  [bad]
	**		Photo_1313_CSG_1.jpg
	**		Photo_1313_CSG_4.jpg
	**  [worse]
	**  	Photo_1313_CSG.jpg [one of the two has been lost]
